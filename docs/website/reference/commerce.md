## What Commerce owns

Commerce adds products, prices, cart and checkout orchestration, receipts, orders and shopper accounts to an EmDash site. The storefront supplies the customer-facing pages; installing Commerce does not create those pages automatically. Commerce owns product identity and the amount a customer pays. [Payments](/docs/reference/payments) owns processor connections, [Ship](/docs/reference/ship) owns shipping labels, and [Inventory](/docs/reference/inventory) owns physical stock when a product is managed.

This reference describes Commerce `{{version}}`, released on the EmDash Registry as `dinkus-commerce` on {{release_date}} (tag `v{{version}}`). It requires EmDash `1.2.0`. Changes merged after that release are not described here until they ship in a stable release.

## Connect to DinkusKit

Commerce connects to DinkusKit.com with a button, and nothing is pasted. An Administrator opens **Dinkus Commerce > Commerce settings** and, under **Connect Commerce**, presses **Connect**. The business owner opens the link it shows, signs in at DinkusKit.com and presses **Approve**; anyone helping can send the owner the same link. Commerce then gets its own store key and keeps it, with the Store ID, in its encrypted DinkusKit connection setting.

Commerce connects first: its Connect makes the store at DinkusKit.com, and Payments and Ship then join that store with their own Connect. After Connect, Commerce fetches its checkout settings from DinkusKit.com itself, when you press **Get checkout settings** and again on every background check. Choose shipping and TEST or live mode in **Set up Commerce** on DinkusKit.com. Shipping is free or a flat charge; a flat charge can also be free once an order's goods, after any discount, reach an amount you set there. If DinkusKit.com no longer knows the store key, the page asks you to Connect again.

Stores that upgraded from `0.4.0` press Connect once; the old Checkout settings and Store key boxes are gone. Connect accepts only Registry installs.

## Admin screens

The store admin uses EmDash's built-in Block Kit screens only. Commerce adds a **Dinkus Commerce** folder to the sidebar with two pages:

| Page | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Orders** | Lists orders. **Inspect #N** opens one, with its status, payment and shipping. |
| **Commerce settings** | Connect, checkout settings, catalog choices (hide out-of-stock products, a placeholder image for products without one), and **Products without a page**, each with **Make a page**. |

There is no separate Commerce Products page. Products are managed on the site's own product pages, described next.

## Merchant store settings

In **Commerce settings**, choose the store country and the physical
shipping destinations. On the first country save, blank destinations default
to that country. Later changes to the store country preserve the destinations;
a saved empty list enables none. The phone requirement can be saved before a
country is chosen.

Checkout checks the shipping destinations for a new physical checkout. With no
destinations enabled, a physical basket cannot proceed to payment. There is no
separate selling/customer country list. These settings do not collect a
billing address or determine taxes or currency.

## One product screen

**Content > Products** is the one place to manage a product. Each product page has two panels beside the editor: **Dinkus Commerce** and **Product image & gallery**.

- On a page with no product, press **Add price and stock**. It makes a Draft product named from the page title, with the SKU you type or one made from the title, and links it to the page. EmDash asks you to apply the link; the page keeps it when you press **Save**. The panel also lists products without a page, so one can be sold on this page instead.
- On a linked page, the panel shows the product's state (Draft, On sale, Published: off the shop or Archived) and SKU, and edits its price and sale price, stock status, choices, weight, and GTIN, MPN and Brand. **Archive** takes it off the shop; **Restore** brings it back as a Draft.
- A product starts as a simple product, and the panel says so. To sell it in more than one version, add a choice such as Size; the product becomes variable and each choice gets its own price, SKU and stock.
- **Product image & gallery** chooses the product's picture and up to eight gallery pictures from the Media Library, in order. It works once the page sells a product; until then it points to **Dinkus Commerce**.
- A product with no Regular price is not for sale, so the panel says **Add a Regular price to sell it**, and a published page's product reads **Published: off the shop** until it has one. Saving with Regular empty answers with the same words instead of **Product saved**.
- The page title is the product's name. Publishing the page copies the title to the product, so the shop, cart, checkout and new orders show it. Paid orders keep the name they were bought under. To rename a product, change the page title and publish. A store must have the publish check that sends the title (DinkusKit Template Store from template-store#158) before it upgrades to this Commerce; until then products keep their current names.

Publishing the page puts the product on sale, and unpublishing or deleting the page takes it off. A new product is a Draft, not buyable, until its page is published. The store's publish check makes this change through a private Commerce route; Commerce itself never reads the CMS.

To show this panel, Commerce `0.6.0` asks for two new permissions when it is installed or upgraded: `admin.editor-draft:read`, to read the page's title and product link, and `admin.editor-draft:patch`, to set only the page's `commerce_item_id` field.

## Saving and upgrading catalog data

Price and stock-status saves, including submitted feed choices, commit together.
Native local-stock hosts keep choice-level tracking changes in that same commit.
Native catalog lists return the product revision for every choice. A native bulk
price request validates sibling choices against that same snapshot and commits
its valid rows together; invalid rows remain individually reported. A competing
product edit refuses the staged rows for that product without a partial save.
A **Save weight** action commits all submitted choice weights together. These
actions work within EmDash's default ten-subrequest sandbox limit. If another
editor changes the product after a form opens, reload before saving again.

If a save succeeds but the panel cannot refresh, Commerce says the changes were
saved and offers **Reload product**. If the write outcome cannot be confirmed,
it says **Save outcome unknown**; reload to check the values before submitting
again. An error is not a reason to assume nothing was stored.

Existing product IDs, SKUs and order snapshots remain unchanged. Old values are
read until each field is saved in the new product record. Cleared values stay
cleared. This transition retains old records but does not write changes back to
them. Run one Commerce version at a time; downgrading after these saves requires
an explicit data conversion. Do not run old and new binaries as concurrent writers.

For direct kernel consumers, price, manual-availability and feed-eligibility
readers now require the catalog reader as their third argument. Use these
readers or the catalog API, rather than reading the legacy collections directly;
raw legacy records may no longer be current. A product supports at most fifty
choices, and saves exceeding the host's 1 MiB record limit are refused before
writing.

## Product identity and pricing

Use the permanent Commerce item ID to look up a product and submit a cart line. The merchant's SKU is a separate editable attribute; a page URL is a host-owned publishing decision.

Prices use USD integer minor units represented as strings. For example, USD 12.00 is `{ "currency": "USD", "minor": "1200" }`. Regular price is required for a simple product to be listable. A missing price does not mean free. An explicit zero Regular price can be listed, but the paid-checkout path must be verified separately. A Sale price requires Regular and must be strictly lower. The customer-facing price is Sale when present, otherwise Regular.

The public catalog filters archived, Draft and nonlistable products. A product can have up to three options (such as Color and Size), up to fifty values per option, and up to fifty variant members. Product families with options expose variant members; they can omit the top-level price. Choose a sellable member and use its `catalogItemId` for checkout. Do not assume every catalog object has a price or that a family ID can be purchased without a choice.

Public catalog list and item responses also carry the feed channels the merchant approved for each product, so a storefront host can build public product feeds without admin reads. A product with no approved channel is never included.

## Availability

Unmanaged products use Commerce's manual availability: `in-stock`, `out-of-stock`, or `available-on-backorder`. They do not require an Inventory connection or expose an invented quantity.

Inventory is planned after v1, and the Registry build has no Manage stock switch. Begin with unmanaged products. Missing setup, malformed provider results, or an unavailable provider must not be interpreted as zero stock or silently replaced with local stock. Treat `availability-unavailable` as unavailable and respect the separate `sellable` and `listable` facts. See the [Inventory reference](/docs/reference/inventory).

## Public storefront routes

Prefix these routes with `/_emdash/api/plugins/<installed-plugin-id>/`. Resolve the actual installed identity; the stable Registry runtime ID is `r_gshdrqaldna3r7sn`, while `dinkus-commerce` identifies the native development entry.

| Route | Method | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `catalog/public` | GET | A page of public products and an optional opaque cursor. |
| `catalog/public/item?itemId=…` | GET | One projected product or `null`; no canonical page URL. |
| `policies/public` | GET | The store's published policies. |
| `checkout/guest/readiness` | GET | The installed checkout readiness response. |
| `checkout/guest/prepare` | POST | An empty request creates a server-issued guest capability. |
| `checkout/guest/start` | POST | Cart lines and required contact details, authorized by that capability. |
| `checkout/guest/status` | POST | The authorized purchase's current checkout projection. |
| `account/sign-in/start` | POST | Emails a shopper a 6-digit sign-in code. |
| `account/sign-in/verify` | POST | Exchanges the code for a shopper session. |
| `account/sign-out` | POST | Ends the shopper session. |
| `account/orders` | GET | The signed-in shopper's orders. |
| `account/profile` | GET, POST | The signed-in shopper's saved delivery address and phone. |

The catalog accepts only its documented query keys. Continue pagination until no cursor remains, including pages whose filtered product list is empty. Media entries carry EmDash media IDs; the host resolves public image URLs.

Checkout rereads authoritative prices and availability. Never send a browser-computed price, tenant, provider choice, or order status as authority. See [site integration](/docs/developers/integrate) for the purchase flow.

Agents and command-line tools read and complete orders through the private `orders` route with an EmDash API token that can manage plugins.

Agents and command-line tools manage products through the private `catalog` route (POST) with an EmDash API token that can edit content. Each request names one `op` and runs the same checks as the product page panels:

| `op` | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `list` | Lists products: id, name, SKU, and when it was archived. |
| `get` | One product (`catalogItemId`) with its choices, prices, pictures and feed channels. |
| `create` | Makes a physical Draft from `name` and `sku`, and links it to the product page `entryId` when given. Send a `commandId` so a retry finds the same product. |
| `link` | Links a product to the product page `entryId`. |
| `prices`, `choice`, `labels`, `sku`, `weight`, `identifiers`, `archive`, `media`, `feeds` | Change prices and stock status, choices and their labels, the SKU, weight, GTIN/MPN/Brand, Archive or Restore, pictures, and product feed eligibility. |

Publishing the page still puts the product on sale, so an agent sells a product by creating it, pricing it and publishing its page. `create` with `entryId` and `link` only record the link for the Dinkus Commerce panel. The page's own **Commerce product** field (`commerce_item_id`) is what the store's publish check reads, so the agent also sets that field to the product's `catalogItemId` and saves the page through EmDash (its content API or MCP) before publishing. The panel does this step itself when a person presses Save. Manage stock stays off, as in the panels. A refused write answers with the reason.

A write may carry `expected`: the first 12 hex digits of the SHA-256 of the product's `get` answer as JSON (for a choice, of its product, named as `productId`). Commerce then saves only while the product still reads that way, so an agent never overwrites a change it did not see.

The `dinkus-commerce` command-line tool wraps these as `products show`, `create`, `set-price`, `set-sale-price`, `set-stock-status`, `set-sku`, `set-weight`, `set-identifiers`, `save-media`, `set-feeds`, `add-choice`, `link`, `archive` and `restore`. Each change shows a preview with `--dry-run` and is sent only with the `--confirm` value it printed, which Commerce checks before it saves.

Select CLI configuration with `--profile <name>` or `DINKUS_COMMERCE_PROFILE`. A requested name must be explicitly defined in a config file's `profiles` object; inherited names do not count. A missing name or malformed selected profile stops with exit `2` before any HTTP request, rather than silently sending a change to the base site. Profile maps and matching entries must be JSON objects; an explicitly defined empty object still inherits that file's base metadata. Existing configuration precedence and restrictions on sending credentials to project-configured sites are unchanged. See the repository's [CLI specification](https://github.com/dinkuskit/commerce/blob/main/docs/CLI-SPEC.md#configuration-and-authentication) for paths and examples.

The CLI's `--timeout` covers each request through reading its response body. A timeout or dropped connection while receiving a response exits with code `3`, even after response headers arrive, and is not automatically retried. For a write, read the product or order before submitting again: an incomplete response does not prove nothing was saved.

## US delivery addresses

A new checkout that ships a physical order to the United States needs a supported US state or the District of Columbia. Commerce accepts the two-letter abbreviation or the full name. Destinations outside the United States that the merchant configured, saved addresses and checkouts already started are not affected.

## Shopper accounts

Shoppers can sign in to the storefront with their email address and a 6-digit code, with no password. Commerce sends the code through the site's EmDash email service, so the site needs working email for sign-in. A code lasts 10 minutes, allows 5 tries, and a new one can be requested after 30 seconds.

A signed-in shopper sees every order placed with the same email address, newest first, including its status, carrier and tracking number when the order has shipped. The account keeps one saved delivery address and phone number, filled in from the shopper's latest order until the shopper changes or clears them.

Shopper accounts are stored by Commerce. They are not EmDash users and give no access to the EmDash admin. The storefront sends the session in the `x-commerce-customer-session` header; the session works only on the site that issued it.

## Installed checkout and orders

The Registry build trades its own store key at DinkusKit.com for short-lived scoped passes and calls hosted Payments and Ship with them. The key never goes to Payments, Ship or a store page. A store that is not connected, or whose checkout settings are missing or turned off, keeps checkout unavailable. An explicit readiness flag from Payments other than the boolean `true` blocks creation of a new payment session. Historical payment lookups do not require current payment readiness.

Commerce runs a background check every five minutes while it is switched on. It settles payments a shopper never returned from, refreshes the checkout settings, then brings Orders and Ship up to date. If the site's scheduler fails or stalls when Commerce is switched on, the next request to Commerce registers the check instead, so the plugin does not need switching off and on.

Reconciliation requires a persisted paid checkout order before acknowledging its payment notice. The separate handoff to the Orders module catches receiver failures so it can be retried; acknowledgement alone is therefore not independent proof that the Orders screen displays the order. A browser return cannot establish payment success. Use the [test-order checks](/docs/store-owners/test-order) and confirm the order in Commerce's Orders screen.

Coupon codes are refused at checkout on Registry stores in this release.
