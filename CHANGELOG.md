## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#111](https://github.com/dinkuskit/commerce/pull/111) [`09e43c8`](https://github.com/dinkuskit/commerce/commit/09e43c856d8db29517c661597215aefc317b7370) Thanks [@saariuslystoned](https://github.com/saariuslystoned)! - Recognize successful Payments checkout-binding responses without a wire `ready` field, so Registry checkout readiness can become supported after the store is configured. Preserve binding identity, provider, account, mode, and refusal checks.

- [#109](https://github.com/dinkuskit/commerce/pull/109) [`b54cac9`](https://github.com/dinkuskit/commerce/commit/b54cac9f70b3356c605e2ac94d8f1e9a2ab77ddb) Thanks [@saariuslystoned](https://github.com/saariuslystoned)! - Shrink the sandboxed plugin bundle from 130,990 to 114,334 bytes (82 bytes of headroom under the 131,072-byte Registry per-file limit, now 16,738) by sharing frequent member-access property names through the build's existing literal-sharing bindings. No behavior changes.

## 0.2.0
